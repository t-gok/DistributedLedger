run commands:
	run.sh NumberOfNodes NumberOfTransactions
	run1.sh : will ask for number of nodes
	run2.sh NumberOfNodes

Add this to report:
Each node has a HB thread that replies hback type message when it is alive.
Each node in before going to state 1 in FSM2, updates its view by using updateView.
Then, it waits for acks only from it's view.
Each failed node after waking up updates it's GQ and GLQ from another node. clears only stale messages.

Note: fail probability = 0.001 . I checked the correctness till 0.004
abort probability: 0.2
